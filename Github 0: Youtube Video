# 🚀 GitHub Web-Only Workflow (Beginner Step-by-Step)

These instructions recreate what we did in the video using **only the GitHub website** (no terminal required).  
By the end, you’ll have a repo with a clean README, a roadmap using Issues, a Branch for safe edits, and a Pull Request (PR) merged into `main`.

---

## ✅ What You’ll Learn

- Create a GitHub repository (repo)
- Write a README using Markdown
- Commit changes on GitHub
- Use Issues as your task list / roadmap
- Create a branch for safe edits
- Open a Pull Request (PR)
- Merge your changes into `main`

---

## 🧠 Quick Glossary (Beginner-Friendly)

- **Repository (Repo):** Your project folder on GitHub (files + history).
- **Commit:** A saved change (“snapshot” of your project).
- **Branch:** A safe copy of your repo where you can experiment.
- **Pull Request (PR):** A request to merge your branch changes into `main`.
- **Merge:** Applying your branch changes to `main`.
- **main:** The default branch (your “official” version).

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- You’re logged into GitHub in your browser

---

# 1️⃣ Create Your Repository

1. Go to GitHub and click your profile icon (top right).
2. Select **Your repositories**.
3. Click the green **New** button.
4. Fill out:
   - **Repository name:** `MyFirstGitHubRepo` (or whatever you want)
   - **Description:** “My first GitHub repo for learning”
   - **Visibility:** **Public** (recommended for portfolio + learning)
5. Click **Create repository**.

✅ Done! You now have a repo.

---

# 2️⃣ Create a README (Your Repo’s “Front Page”)

Your README is what people see first. It should answer:  
**What is this? What’s inside? What’s next?**

## ✍️ Create the README

1. On the repo page, click **Add a README** (or create a new file if the repo is empty).
2. Name the file: `README.md`
3. Paste this starter template:

    # MyFirstGitHubRepo

    A beginner-friendly repo where I’m practicing GitHub fundamentals (web-only).

    ## 📌 What’s inside
    - Notes from learning GitHub
    - Small experiments
    - Future project files

    ## 🗺️ Roadmap
    - [ ] Add a simple project structure
    - [ ] Add a screenshot or visual
    - [ ] Add a “Resources” section

## 💾 Commit the README

4. Click **Commit changes…**
5. Commit message example: `Add initial README`
6. Click **Commit changes**

✅ Your README should now render on the repo homepage.

---

# 3️⃣ Create Issues (Your Roadmap / Task List)

Issues help you keep track of what you want to build next.

1. Click the **Issues** tab.
2. Click **New issue**.
3. Add:
   - **Title:** `Add screenshot to README`
   - **Description:** Why you want it + what “done” looks like
4. Click **Submit new issue**.

### 🔥 Good beginner Issue ideas
- “Add folder structure (notes/projects/resources)”
- “Add learning notes for GitHub basics”
- “Add resources section (links to docs/tutorials)”
- “Add badges (later)”

✅ Now you have a plan.

---

# 4️⃣ Create a Branch (Safe Changes Without Breaking main)

Branches let you make changes safely without affecting `main`.

1. Click the **Code** tab.
2. Open the branch dropdown (it usually says `main`).
3. Type a new branch name:
   - Example: `Update-Read-ME`
4. Click **Create branch: Update-Read-ME**

✅ You are now working on your branch (not `main`).

---

# 5️⃣ Make Changes on the Branch

## 📝 Edit the README on the branch

1. Open `README.md`
2. Click the pencil icon (**Edit this file**)
3. Make a small improvement (examples):
   - Fix wording
   - Add a “What you’ll learn” section
   - Add links
4. Click **Commit changes…**
5. Commit message example: `Improve README formatting`
6. Make sure the commit is going to your branch (`Update-Read-ME`)
7. Click **Commit changes**

## ➕ Optional: Add a simple extra file

1. Click **Add file** → **Create new file**
2. Name it something useful, like:
   - `INSTRUCTIONS.md` (this tutorial)
   - `NOTES.md` (your learning notes)
3. Add a sentence or two
4. Click **Commit changes…** (commit to the branch)

✅ Your branch now has changes that `main` does not.

---

# 6️⃣ Open a Pull Request (PR)

A PR is how you propose merging your branch work back into `main`.

1. Click the **Pull requests** tab.
2. Click **New pull request**
3. Set:
   - **Base:** `main`
   - **Compare:** `Update-Read-ME`
4. Check the preview to confirm the changes look right
5. PR title example: `Update README`
6. Description example: `Improved README formatting and added a notes file.`
7. Click **Create pull request**

✅ PR created.

---

# 7️⃣ Merge Your PR Into main

1. In your PR, check for **“Able to merge”**
2. Click **Merge pull request**
3. Click **Confirm merge**
4. (Optional) Delete the branch if GitHub offers it  
   (This is normal and keeps your repo clean.)

✅ Your changes are now merged into `main`.

---

# 8️⃣ Verify Everything on main

1. Go back to the **Code** tab.
2. Switch branch dropdown back to `main`
3. Confirm:
   - README changes are visible
   - New files are there
   - Commit history shows a merge commit

✅ You’re done — this is the basic GitHub workflow.

---

## 🧯 Troubleshooting (Quick Fixes)

- **I don’t see my changes**
  - Make sure you’re viewing the `main` branch (branch dropdown).
- **My PR can’t merge**
  - This usually means “conflicts.” Keep edits small and avoid changing the same lines in different places.
- **README formatting looks weird**
  - Confirm the file is named `README.md`
  - Use headings consistently (`#`, `##`, `###`)

---

## 🌱 Next Upgrades (Optional, But Great for Portfolio)

- Add a `LICENSE`
- Add `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Add a simple folder structure:
  - `/notes`
  - `/projects`
  - `/resources`
- Add a “Start Here” link at the top of your README
