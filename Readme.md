# My First GitHub Repo

## What this is
This is my first GitHub repository. I’m using it to learn how GitHub works and to practice
building a clean, professional project page.

## What you’ll find here
- A README (this page)
- Example files to practice uploading and updating
- A simple workflow using branches and pull requests
- 
## How to use this repo
If you’re learning GitHub, you can copy this repo setup and use it as your own practice
space.

## Roadmap (what I’ll add next)
- Add a folder structure
- Add a screenshot
- Add an Issues checklist
- Add a simple GitHub Action badge
